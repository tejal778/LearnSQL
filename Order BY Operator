We can sort the results using ORDER BY, either alphabetically or numerically. 
Sorting the results often makes the data more useful and easier to analyze.

Example:

If we want to sort everything by the movieâ€™s title from A through Z:

SELECT *
FROM movies
ORDER BY name;

ORDER BY is a clause that indicates you want to sort the result set by a particular column.

name is the specified column.

Example:

If we want to select all of the well-received movies, sorted from highest to lowest by their year:

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE imdb_rating > 8
ORDER BY year DESC;

DESC is a keyword used in ORDER BY to sort the results in descending order (high to low or Z-A).

ASC is a keyword used in ORDER BY to sort the results in ascending order (low to high or A-Z).

Example:
Suppose we want to retrieve the name and year columns of all the movies, ordered by their name alphabetically.

Type the following code:

SELECT name, year
FROM movies
ORDER BY name;

Example:
SELECT name, year, imdb_rating
FROM movies
ORDER BY imdb_rating DESC;
