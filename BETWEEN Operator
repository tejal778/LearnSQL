The BETWEEN operator is used in a WHERE clause to filter the result set within a certain range. 
It accepts two values that are either numbers, text or dates.

EXAMPLE:

1) SELECT *
   FROM movies
   WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999;

2) BETWEEN filters the result set to only include movies with names that begin with the letter ‘A’ up to, but not including ones that begin with ‘J’.

   SELECT *
   FROM movies
   WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'J';
