Combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause to make the result set more specific and useful.

Example:
Here, we use the AND operator to only return 90â€™s romance movies.

SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999
   AND genre = 'romance';

year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999 is the 1st condition.
genre = 'romance' is the 2nd condition.
AND combines the two conditions.

Example:
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979
  AND imdb_rating > 8;
