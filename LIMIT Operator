In the case where SQL tables have hundreds of thousands of rows it is important to limit these. 
LIMIT operator does this

Example:
SELECT *
FROM movies
LIMIT 10;

LIMIT is a clause that lets you specify the maximum number of rows the result set will have. This saves space on our screen and makes our queries run faster.
Here, we specify that the result set canâ€™t have more than 10 rows.
LIMIT always goes at the very end of the query. Also, it is not supported in all SQL databases.

Example:

SELECT * 
FROM movies
ORDER BY imdb_rating DESC
LIMIT 3;

Write a query that returns the top 3 highest rated movies.
