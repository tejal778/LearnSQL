Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.

CODE:
SELECT MIN(founded)

CODE:
SELECT AVG(valuation)
FROM startups;

CODE:
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

Lastly, order the list from highest averages to lowest.
CODE:
