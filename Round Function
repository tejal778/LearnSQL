By default, SQL tries to be as precise as possible without rounding. We can make the result table easier to read using the ROUND() function.

ROUND() function takes two arguments inside the parenthesis:

a column name
an integer

Example:
It rounds the values in the column to the number of decimal places specified by the integer.

SELECT ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;

Example:
SELECT name, ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;

EXAMPLE:
In the last exercise, we were able to get the average price of an app ($2.02365) using this query:

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM fake_apps;

Now, letâ€™s edit this query so that it rounds this result to 2 decimal places.

--> SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2)
FROM fake_apps;
